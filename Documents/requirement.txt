Honggang,

Attached is information that you will require to develop the ¡®Corn K Calculator¡¯.

It would use cost of K2O and corn price, and whether the field fell into the low smectite/illite ratio or high, and the soil test to determine rate.

There probably should also be a chart that converts tonnage price of 0-0-60 K fertilizer to price K2O.

We can visit about it when you get a chance.
